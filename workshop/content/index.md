In this lab, you will learn to use the Couchbase operator on the OpenShift Container Platform. We will first examine how to deploy a new couchbase cluster and then move on to tasks such as adding users and rebalancing the cluster when nodes are added.

Couchbase is a distributed (shared-nothing architecture) multi-model NoSQL document-oriented database software package that is optimized for interactive applications. These applications may serve many concurrent users by creating, storing, retrieving, aggregating, manipulating and presenting data. In support of these kinds of application needs, Couchbase Server is designed to provide easy-to-scale key-value or JSON document access with low latency and high sustained throughput. It is designed to be clustered from a single machine to very large-scale deployments spanning many machines.

Before you can use Couchbase for your applications, you need to deploy a Couchbase server cluster.
